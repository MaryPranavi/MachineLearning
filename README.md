# Flight Price Prediction

In this project, a predictive model will be created using machine learning algorithms to predict the flight prices for various flights. We will be analyzing the flight fare prediction using machine learning dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features.

## DATASET

Data was used from Kaggle.

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh

The dataset contains 11 input features. The output column “price” should be predicted on this set. We use a regression technique here because the predicted output will be continuous. The features available in the dataset are Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time, Duration, Total_Stops, Additional_Info, and Price

We are using jupyter notebook to run Flight Price Prediction task.
-	Airline: So this column will have all the types of airlines like Indigo, Jet Airways, Air India, and many more.
-	Date_of_Journey: This column will let us know about the date on which the passenger’s journey will start.
-	Source: This column holds the name of the place from where the passenger’s journey will start.
-	Destination: This column holds the name of the place to where passengers wanted to travel.
-	Route: Here we can know about that what is the route through which passengers have opted to travel from his/her source to their destination.
-	Dep_Time: Departure time is when the passenger will depart from his/her source.
-	Arrival_Time: Arrival time is when the passenger will reach his/her destination.
-	Duration: Duration is the whole period that a flight will take to complete its journey from source to destination.
-	Total_Stops: This will let us know in how many places flights will stop there for the flight in the whole journey.
-	Additional_Info: In this column, we will get information about food, kind of food, and other amenities.
-	Price: Price of the flight for a complete journey including all the expenses before onboarding.

## METHOD

Our approach involves a comprehensive methodology, encompassing Data analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and feature engineering. Each step is meticulously crafted to extract meaningful patterns from the dataset and enhance the predictive power of our machine learning models.
-	Data Analysis: Extracting valuable information using mathematical techniques.
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering insights from the dataset.
-	Data Visualization: Creating visual representations for better understanding.
-	Feature Engineering: Enhancing model performance through innovative feature creation.
-	Machine Learning Models: Deploying regression models for accurate flight price predictions.
